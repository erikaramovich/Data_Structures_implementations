# Data Structures Implementations in C++

This repository contains custom implementations of fundamental data structures using C++.  
It was created for educational purposes to deepen my understanding of how data structures work under the hood.

## 📂 Implemented Structures

- **Vector** – Dynamic array with automatic resizing  
- **Stack** – LIFO structure implemented with array or linked list  
- **List** – Doubly linked list implementation  
- **Queue** – FIFO structure with optional circular buffer version  
- **Map** – Key-value store using binary search tree  
- **Unordered_Map** – Hash table implemented with open addressing or chaining

## 🔧 Features

- Each data structure is implemented from scratch — no use of STL containers  
- Clean and modular C++ code (header/source separation)  
- Includes simple usage examples and basic test cases  
- Written with readability and performance in mind

## 📌 Purpose

- Strengthen understanding of core data structure internals  
- Practice object-oriented programming and memory management in C++  
- Prepare for technical interviews and coding challenges

## 🛠️ Requirements

- C++11 or later
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Make or CMake (optional for build automation)
